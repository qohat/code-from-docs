# code-from-docs

A demo of **doc-driven code generation** with GitHub Actions and Claude Code.

You keep the spec in `docs/`. One workflow turns the docs into a GitHub issue
backlog; another picks up each issue, writes the code on a branch, and opens a
pull request for you to review. The thing being built is a small **functional
agent harness** in Rust (`src/`) — small enough to watch the whole loop work.

```
edit docs/ ──▶ generate-backlog ──▶ GitHub issues ──▶ auto-maintain ──▶ pull requests ──▶ you review & merge
```

## Harness architecture

The Rust crate is a **functional-core** agent harness: the core is pure and
deterministic (no I/O, no mutation), and every side effect lives at the edge in
`main.rs`. The single place a real LLM would plug in is the `Planner` — a plain
`fn(&Conversation) -> Decision`.

### Modules & dependencies

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph EDGE["🔌 Edge — side effects allowed"]
        MAIN["main.rs<br/>wire tools + planner · print transcript"]
    end
    subgraph CORE["🧊 Functional core — pure · deterministic · no I/O"]
        HARNESS["harness.rs<br/>run() · bounded fold loop"]
        AGENT["agent.rs<br/>Agent · Planner · Decision"]
        TOOL["tool.rs<br/>Tool · Toolbox · ToolError"]
        MSG["message.rs<br/>Message · Conversation (immutable)"]
    end
    MAIN --> HARNESS
    HARNESS --> AGENT
    HARNESS --> TOOL
    HARNESS --> MSG
    AGENT --> MSG
```

### The run loop

`run(agent, tools, task, max_steps)` seeds a conversation and folds one
`Decision` at a time. Tool results become observations fed back to the planner;
the loop stops on `Reply` or when the step budget is spent (`Exhausted`).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant U as Caller (task)
    participant H as harness::run
    participant P as Planner (Agent)
    participant T as Toolbox
    U->>H: task + max_steps
    Note over H: seed Conversation<br/>[System, User]
    loop until Reply or max_steps
        H->>P: decide(conversation)
        alt Decision::UseTool { tool, input }
            P-->>H: use a tool
            H->>T: invoke(tool, input)
            T-->>H: observation (Ok | error-as-value)
            Note over H: append Assistant call + Tool observation
        else Decision::Reply(answer)
            P-->>H: final answer
            H-->>U: Outcome::Replied(answer)
        end
    end
    Note over H,U: budget exhausted → Outcome::Exhausted
```

## How the workflows fit together

The pipeline is split into **reusable** building blocks and thin **caller**
workflows that only orchestrate:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    DOCS["📄 docs/*.md<br/>source of truth"] -->|push to docs/ or manual| GB["generate-backlog.yml"]
    GB --> RC1["reusable-claude<br/>reads docs + src"]
    RC1 -->|gh issue create| ISSUES["🗂️ Issues<br/>labels: spec, auto-maintain"]
    ISSUES -->|label auto-maintain| AM["auto-maintain.yml"]
    AM --> RC2["reusable-claude<br/>implements the issue"]
    RC2 -->|branch auto/issue-N + PR| PR["🔀 Pull request"]
    PR --> CI["ci.yml<br/>fmt · build · clippy · test"]
    CI --> HUMAN["👤 human review & merge"]
    GB -. success/failure .-> DISCORD["reusable-discord"]
    AM -. success/failure .-> DISCORD
```


| Workflow | Trigger | Does |
|----------|---------|------|
| `generate-backlog.yml` | manual, or dispatched by `docs-watch` | hashes docs vs `specs/backlog-state.json` (memory), files one issue per **new/changed** Planned capability, commits updated state |
| `docs-watch.yml` | push to `docs/**` | translates the push into a `workflow_dispatch` of `generate-backlog` (the Claude action rejects raw `push` events) |
| `auto-maintain.yml` | issue labelled `auto-maintain`, or manual | runner branches `auto/issue-<n>` from `main` and formats/commits/pushes (git, not AI); Claude only writes code + tests; then opens a PR and comments the Claude **session cost** |
| `ci.yml` | every PR + push to `main` | `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo build`, `clippy -D warnings`, `cargo test` — the gate for auto-generated PRs |
| `reusable-claude.yml` | `workflow_call` | checkout + `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` (headless); reads the prompt from `prompt_file` (vars via `session_env`), optionally branches from `main`/formats/pushes, outputs `cost_usd`/`num_turns` |
| `reusable-notify.yml` | `workflow_call` | maps a `success`/`failure` outcome to a standardized title/message and calls `reusable-discord` (used once per workflow with `if: always()`) |
| `reusable-discord.yml` | `workflow_call` | posts a success/failure embed to a Discord webhook |
| `reusable-pr-comment.yml` | `workflow_call` | posts a Markdown comment on a PR (auto-maintain uses it to report cost) |

Callers invoke the reusables with `uses:` and pass credentials with
`secrets: inherit`, so **no secret is ever written into a workflow file**.
Each caller declares least-privilege `permissions:` (backlog = `issues: write`
only; auto-maintain = `contents`/`issues`/`pull-requests: write`).

## Setup

1. **Push this repo to GitHub** and install the
   [Claude GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/claude) on it.
2. **Add repository secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions).
   See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the exact names:
   - `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` — from `claude setup-token`.
   - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` — a Discord Incoming Webhook.
3. **Generate the backlog:** Actions → *Generate Backlog from Docs* → *Run
   workflow* (tick *dry run* first to preview). Issues appear labelled `spec`
   and `auto-maintain`.
4. **Let it code:** adding the `auto-maintain` label triggers
   *Auto-Maintain (Issue → PR)*, which opens a PR. Review and merge.

Nothing merges automatically — humans hold the merge button.

## Using this in your own repo

This repo is a portable template. To wire the same pipeline into another project
(any language), follow **[ADOPTING.md](ADOPTING.md)** — it lists which files to
copy, what to change per repo, and the non-obvious gotchas already solved.

## Run the demo locally

```bash
cargo run            # prints a transcript from the demo agent
cargo test           # behavioural tests
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

## Contributing

Contributions are **docs-first**: you describe behaviour in `docs/`, let
`generate-backlog` turn it into spec issues, and let `auto-maintain` (or a
human) implement them. The full workflow — including how to run the backlog
generator — is in **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**. Coding conventions the
agent (and you) must follow live in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
