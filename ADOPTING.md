# Adopting code-from-docs in your own repo

This repo is a working template for a **doc-driven code-generation pipeline**:
you keep the spec in `docs/`, a workflow turns it into GitHub issues, another
implements each issue as a PR, and CI gates everything. The Rust crate here is
just the *demo target* — the pipeline itself is language-agnostic.

This guide is meta-documentation about the pipeline, so it lives at the repo
root **on purpose**: anything under `docs/` is treated as product spec and would
be turned into backlog issues.

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Install the [Claude GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/claude)** on the
  target repo. The OAuth flow needs it to mint a GitHub token via OIDC.
- **Repository secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
  | Secret | Required | Source |
  |--------|----------|--------|
  | `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | ✅ | `claude setup-token` |
  | `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | optional | Discord → Integrations → Webhooks |
- GitHub Actions enabled. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` may stay **read-only** —
  each workflow requests exactly the scopes it needs.

## 2. Files to copy

```

## 3. What to change per repo

1. **`ci.yml`** — replace the Rust steps (`cargo fmt` / `build` / `clippy` /
   `test`) with your stack's format + build + lint + test.
2. **Build-tool allowlist** in `auto-maintain.yml` → `claude_args` →
   `--allowedTools`: swap `Bash(cargo:*)` for `Bash(npm:*)`, `Bash(go:*)`, etc.
   Leave `Bash(gh:*)`, `Bash(git:*)`, `Read`, `Edit`, `Write` in place.
3. **`CLAUDE.md`** — your conventions and the *definition of done* the agent must
   satisfy before opening a PR.
4. **`docs/`** — your specs. Keep the tagging convention: mark each capability
   🚧 **Planned** or ✅ **Implemented**; the generator only files issues for
   Planned ones and skips Implemented ones.
4b. **`.github/prompts/*.md`** — how the agent behaves. These are plain text, so
   editing them needs no YAML. `reusable-claude` reads a `prompt_file` and
   substitutes any `session_env` vars (e.g. `$ISSUE_NUMBER`, `$CHANGED_DOCS`)
   into the text before the run — keep those `$VAR` placeholders when editing.
5. **Model** — `--model claude-sonnet-4-6` in the `claude_args` if you want a
   different tier.
6. **Labels** — `spec` and `auto-maintain` are created automatically on first
   run; rename in the prompts if you prefer.

## 4. How the pieces fit

```
docs/ push ─▶ docs-watch ─▶ (workflow_dispatch) ─▶ generate-backlog
                                                     ├─ detect  (sha256 vs specs/backlog-state.json)
                                                     ├─ backlog (Claude files issues for changed docs)
                                                     └─ persist (commits updated state)
issue labelled auto-maintain ─▶ auto-maintain:
    implement (runner branches auto/issue-N from main → Claude edits code+tests → runner formats, commits, pushes)
    └─ open-pr (gh) ─▶ comment session cost (reusable-pr-comment) ─▶ ci ─▶ human merge
```

The **git plumbing is deterministic**: branching from `main`, `cargo fmt`,
commit, push and PR creation all run in the runner (git/`gh`), not the model, so
they can't be skipped and cost no AI tokens. Claude only edits code + tests.

- **Memory:** `specs/backlog-state.json` holds a `sha256` per doc. Only new/
  changed docs are processed; delete an entry (or pass `-f force=true`) to
  reprocess.
- **Reusable + callers:** callers pass credentials with `secrets: inherit`, so
  no secret is ever written into a workflow file.
- **Cost reporting:** `reusable-claude.yml` reads the Claude execution log and
  exposes `cost_usd` + `num_turns` as outputs; `auto-maintain` resolves the PR
  for `auto/issue-N` and calls `reusable-pr-comment.yml` to post the session
  cost as a PR comment. Reuse the same block to report cost anywhere else.

## 5. Gotchas already solved (keep these!)

These are non-obvious and cost real debugging — don't "simplify" them away:

| Symptom | Fix (already in place) |
|---------|------------------------|
| `startup_failure` on every reusable call | **No `permissions:` block in `reusable-claude.yml`** — a reusable job requesting more than the caller grants aborts at startup. Each caller grants its own least-privilege set. |
| `Could not fetch an OIDC token` | **`id-token: write`** on every caller (OAuth uses OIDC). |
| `Unsupported event type: push` | **`docs-watch.yml`** translates a `push` into a `workflow_dispatch`; the Claude action rejects raw `push`. |
| `Workflow initiated by non-human actor` | **`allowed_bots: "*"`** in `reusable-claude.yml` (the watcher dispatches as the github-actions bot). |
| 8 permission denials, 0 issues created | Use broad **`Bash(gh:*)`**, not granular `Bash(gh issue create:*)` (multi-word prefixes don't match). |
| PR opened by the agent fails CI on formatting | The model is unreliable at running/committing the format gate. **Do mechanical steps in the runner** (`reusable-claude` inputs `base_ref`/`work_branch`/`format_cmd`): branch from main, `cargo fmt`, commit, push — deterministic, no AI cost. The agent only edits code + tests. |

## 6. First run

1. Push the files to `main`, install the Claude App, add the secrets.
2. Actions → **Generate Backlog from Docs** → Run workflow (tick *dry run* to
   preview). Issues appear labelled `spec` + `auto-maintain`.
3. Add the `auto-maintain` label to an issue (generated issues have it) → a PR
   opens on `auto/issue-<n>`. Review, let CI pass, merge.

Nothing merges automatically — a human always holds the merge button.
